# Pothole-Detection-and-Alert-System-
The Pothole Detection and Alert System is an automated solution designed to identify and report potholes in road images captured by surveillance or vehicle-mounted cameras. Using deep learning models like YOLOv5, the system detects potholes in real-time, helping authorities take prompt action for road repairs and ensuring safer roads for drivers.

This system integrates computer vision with cloud computing technologies, utilizing AWS for storage and alert notifications. It uploads images with detected potholes to AWS S3 and sends real-time alerts to stakeholders through AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service). This streamlined process helps improve road maintenance efficiency and safety, reducing the time it takes to address road hazards.

**Key Features**
1. Pothole Detection: The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model (YOLOv5) to accurately detect potholes in uploaded images.

2. Cloud Integration: Detected pothole images are uploaded to AWS S3, providing secure cloud storage for easy access and further analysis.
   
3. Alert Notification: The system sends automated alerts via AWS SNS to notify authorities or maintenance teams about detected potholes and their location.
   
4. API Integration: A Flask-based API accepts image files and returns pothole detection results, providing an easy interface for integration with other systems.

**Tech Stack**
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Web Framework: Flask for the API server
3. Deep Learning Model: YOLOv5 for pothole detection (TensorFlow)
4. Computer Vision: OpenCV for image processing
5. Cloud Services: AWS S3 for storage, AWS SNS for notifications

**How It Works**
1. Upload Image: Users upload road images to the API endpoint.
2. Pothole Detection: The image is processed by the YOLOv5 model to detect potholes.
3. Storage and Alert: The image is uploaded to AWS S3, and an alert is sent via AWS SNS if potholes are detected.
